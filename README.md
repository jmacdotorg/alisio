# alisio

This is a command-line tool that posts an image-preview of a recent blog post to Twitter, complete with a call-to-action to read the full post at the blog's own website. It adds an appropriate hyperlink to the tweet's text, in an attempt to make this easy Twitter-browsing humans and others.

When configured with a Twitter account and a blog's Atom feed, this program upon invocation will fetch that blog's basic information and most recent post, then create a new tweet containing the following elements:

* The blog's name

* The title of the most recent post

* A link to the most recent post

* **And this is the kicker â€”** An image containing the most recent post's first paragraph, followed by an exhortation to read the rest of the post by clicking the attached link or just going to the blog's front page.

## Example output

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You can find all this tool's prerequisite software through your favorite package manager (`brew` or `yum` or `apt-get` or whatever).

* [Pango](http://www.pango.org), giving you the `pango-view` command-line program.

* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org), giving you the `mogrify` command-line program.

* [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org). (If the command `xml2-config --version` returns something that looks like a version number, you're probably OK.)

### Perl modules

If you enjoy blindly running `curl | bash` invocations straight off of GitHub README files as much as I do, then you can just do this:

    curl -fsSL https://cpanmin.us | perl - --installdeps .
    
More conservative users can install [cpanm] manually and then run `cpanm --installdeps .` instead.

## Configuration

Copy conf/alisio-example.conf to conf/alisio.conf, then update as the file itself directs. (You can instead copy the file to some other location and then tell alisio about it at runtime, per "Usage", below.)

In order to fill in all four required consumer/access-token keys, you will probably need to go to [apps.twitter.com](http://apps.twitter.com) and register a new app and then give yourself access tokens to it.

## Usage

If the config file is "../config/alisio.conf" relative to the alisio script's location on the filesystem, just run it with no arguments.

Otherwise, run it like so:

    alisio --config=/path/to/alisio.conf

Either way, it should do the right thing, unless it doesn't, per the following section.

## Bugs and TODD

This is super-alpha and doesn't even have a version number on it yet. Use at your own risk.

* No tests yet. ("Wait, come back," I say in a sleepy voice.)

* Rather inflexible. (Can't set the font to use, or the image background, etc.)

* It should really be able to work with both Atom and RSS. Well, it doesn't.

* Blog posts with absurdly long titles will make the tweet-post fail silently.

* Unexpected uses of the `<link>` element in the Atom document can make the program fail.

* Honestly, anything unexpected will make the program fail, because: no tests yet.
